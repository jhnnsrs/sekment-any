# Sekment Any (Playground)

Sekment Any is an arkitekt enabled app that brings the power of the Segment Anything to Arkitekt Workflows.
The goal of this app is to provide a simple and easy way to integrated primitves for interactively segmenting data.

## Installation

This is supposed to be an arkitekt app that is installed via the arkitekt app store. 

## Development
If you want to develop this app, you can use the devcontainer provided in this repository.
The github repo does not contain the weights for the model, so you need to download them from the original sam website

```bash

curl -O https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth

```

## Usage

The app is supposed to be used in the arkitekt workflow or as a standalone app.
Currently, the app is just hyper prototype and is not ready for any usage.
